    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to manage lease agreements and payments efficiently. Each lease agreement is stored under a specific landlord's user ID, providing clear ownership and access control. Payments are then stored as subcollections within each lease agreement, enabling easy retrieval of payment history for a specific lease. This design emphasizes path-based ownership, which simplifies security rules and provides clear data isolation. To achieve Authorization Independence, no denormalization is needed as access control relies solely on path-based ownership, with each landlord having full access to data stored under their respective user ID.\n\nThis structure is QAP-compliant because:\n\n1.  **Segregation:** Lease agreements and payments are stored separately, which clarifies access needs and simplifies rules.\n2.  **Path-Based Ownership:** Each landlord's data is isolated under their `userId`, preventing unauthorized access to other landlords' information.\n3.  **Hierarchical paths for User-Owned Data**: It supports the `User 1:N Entity` relationship using path-based ownership."
