/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for a property management application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * All data, including lease agreements and their associated payments, is considered private
 * and owned by the user (landlord) who created it. There is no public or shared data.
 * A user can only access data that exists directly under their own user ID in the path.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically to reflect ownership clearly:
 * /users/{userId}/...
 * This structure ensures that all data for a specific user is isolated within their
 * own data tree, simplifying security and queries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Data Isolation: Users are strictly confined to their own data tree. They cannot
 *   read, write, or even know about the existence of data belonging to other users.
 * - No Public Listing: It is impossible for any user to list all lease agreements or
 *   all users in the system.
 * - Path and Data Integrity: Rules enforce that documents contain internal IDs (like a
 *   `userId`) that match the IDs in their document path. This prevents data from being

 *   created in the wrong location and ensures relational integrity.
