/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for a property management application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * All data is considered private and owned by the user (landlord) who created it.
 * A user can only access data that exists directly under their own user ID or
 * contains their `ownerId`.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId} (Profile information)
 * - /{collection}/{docId} (Top-level collections like buildings, leaseAgreements, etc.)
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Data Isolation: Users are strictly confined to their own data.
 * - Path and Data Integrity: Rules enforce that created/updated documents contain an `ownerId`
 *   that matches the authenticated user's UID.
